       of updating elements.  Recode `setPlotParameters` and
       `setGridParameters` to recursively update dictionary elements.

       data source arguments.

 - [ ] Do we have to declare everything in __init__ first or can be
       push all that to respective reset/clear functions?
 - [ ] refactor messaging/logging of GridUtils into its own package
       so we can import printMsg/debugMsg as standalone calls
 - [ ] Add a formal logging/message mechanism.
   - [X] Allow display of important messages and warnings in panel
         application: widget=TextAreaInput

   - [ ] pytest: allow certain tests to fail if a module is not
         available (issue warnings instead)

# WISH

 - [ ] Add more features to the ice-9 algorithm
   - [ ] zEdits
   - [ ] Multiple seed points
   - [ ] Periodic grid support
 - [ ] Update gridTools.yml with some pinned versions to help package resolution
 - [ ] Write example program(s)
   - [ ] Example 04 : DASK: mkGridsEample4a.ipynb is incomplete
   - [ ] Example 09a: Save ROMS grid after editing
 - [ ] Support for multiple tiles for a model grid
 - [ ] Harmonize filename operations in functions
 - [ ] Teach grid tools to use "input.nml" to find grid related things
       for model runs.
 - [ ] Do a head-to-head comparison of FRE-NCtools vs gridtools using an example
       grid.  See if we can leverage both tools abilities.
   - [X] Debug FRE-NCtools; no topography works at the moment; segfaults all around
     - REF: https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FRE-NCtools/issues/35
     - Requires increase of MAXXGRID to a higher number for GEBCO 2020 to work
     - Requires vertical grid
   - [X] GEBCO 2020
   - [ ] ETOPO1
   - [X] ETOPO2
   - [ ] Investigate the differences between FRE-NCtools vs gridutils.  Are
         there things that we could use there instead of recreating many wheels.
         There are lot of FRE-NCtool references in the ROMS to MOM6
         conversion tool.
 - [ ] Allow gridtools to continue to operate with some disabled
       routines that use xesmf.  Perform module detection.
 - [ ] app:Save remote files; additional sanity checks
 - [ ] app:Add an activity spinner to indicate the notebook is busy
 - [ ] Compute `angle_dy` for testing of grid conformality.  Theoretically,
       we can do this check for all grid and supergrid cells.
 - [ ] Grid conversion
   - [X] Allow conversion of ROMS grids to MOM6 grids
     - [ ] improve just clobbering shallower points with masking_depth

       some of the sample MOM6 problems

   - [ ] MOM6 dumbbell: https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6/search?q=dumbbell
     - [ ] Support for grid variable and plotting
     - [ ] Learn about OBC preparation and sponges
 - [ ] Refactor any grid math into a gridmath library. Any grid
       computation that can stand on its own should be moved into a
       separate gridmath library.
 - [ ] gridtools.makeGrid() will need a refactor to work with other grid types
 - [ ] refactor expansion/clipping of grid points when fitting grid
 - [ ] Dask optimizations
   - [ ] creating the native IBCAO grid is too big for mybinder.org
 - [ ] Subset any grid for running with MOM6
   - [ ] `https://github.com/ESMG/regionalMOM6_notebooks/tree/master/creating_obc_input_files`
   - [ ] May be especially useful for debugging situations; Arctic6
 - [ ] Allow gridtools to be used without xesmf and xgcm; enable module
       detection for available capabilities
 - [ ] Update setup.py and other files with package dependencies
   - [ ] Create a configuration script that would perform autosetup of
         gridtools library
 - [ ] Pull in BC and forcing fields from various sources
   - [ ] Delta method: "We extract 20-30 years of a future projection
         from several models, build an average of each forcing variable
         which we superpose on modern day climate.  It’s the so-called
         delta method.  It debiases climate projections relative to
         modern day (reanalysis constrained) dynamics, but adds the
         climate change signal on top of it (as a secular change/delta)."

       depending on context.

# QUESTIONS

 - [ ] ntiles,1 is written in `write_MOM6_topography_file`, is this
       required for MOM6?
